# Academic Paper Notes - 2024 ðŸ“š

This repository is dedicated to keeping track of the academic papers I read throughout the year. The table below categorizes each paper, provides links to the paper and my personal notes, and includes additional comments where necessary.

Some of the papers I read are not included in this repository because they are not relevant to my research interests. Some of them I did not finish the notes yet. I also do not include papers that I read but do not understand. 

I will try to keep this repository updated as I read more papers.
